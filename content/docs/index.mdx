# Welcome to Tasteey

**Tasteey** is a modern, flexible, and high-performance UI component library built for React. It leverages the power of **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Framer Motion** for silky smooth animations.

<Callout title="Ready to build?" type="info">
  Tasteey is designed to be copy-pasted directly into your project. You own the code.
